# Virtual Bar

## Virtually a Real Bar


The Virtual bar is a place to enjoy the simple niceties of a real bar while the pandemic has us all locked down. 
Obviously, we are not currently able to enjoy real bars due to the virus situation, so I want to bring a little slice
of the bar experience to our home. 

Functionally the Virtual Bar will act as a storage system for cocktail recipes as well as a repository for the current 
inventory and stock of your home bar. This way you will always know what ingredients you have at your disposal and what 
recipes can be prepared with what's on hand. This is the primary functionality of the project, with a few extra 
features included to make these lists work for the user. The Virtual Bar will allow you to add your own cocktail 
recipes, edit existing recipes, and view them by primary spirit, and ingredients on hand. 

However, everybody knows that the bar experience isn't made up entirely of drinking alcohol. There's a clear social 
aspect that comes with heading down to the local to enjoy a few drinks and take in the ambience. This is something that
the Virtual Bar seeks to emulate. The virtual bar will come with a fully (**read limited**) interactive bartender as 
well as a *somewhat* diverse cast of characters that can be seen enjoying the service at this computerized bar.

Ultimately, this project is meant for anyone who enjoys drinking **responsibly** at home and wants a little fun 
to distract from the reality of the global situation. I came up with this idea because I personally fall into this 
category with my increasing need for social interaction acting as a driver for the fun little Easter eggs I hope to 
include in this project. On a more practical level, it strikes me as both a realistic project for this course, and a 
chance for me to play with some fun features to fill out the functionality.
