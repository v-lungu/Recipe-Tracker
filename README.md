# Virtual Bar

## Virtually a Real Bar


The Virtual bar is a place to enjoy the simple niceties of a real bar while the pandemic has us all locked down. 
Obviously, we are not currently able to enjoy real bars due to the virus situation, so I want to bring a little slice
of the bar experience to our home. 

Functionally the Virtual Bar will act as a storage system for cocktail recipes as well as a repository for the current 
inventory and stock of your home bar. This way you will always know what ingredients you have at your disposal and what 
recipes can be prepared with what's on hand. This is the primary functionality of the project, with a few extra 
features included to make these lists work for the user. The Virtual Bar will allow you to add your own cocktail 
recipes, edit existing recipes, and view them by ingredients on hand. 

Ultimately, this project is meant for anyone who enjoys drinking **responsibly** at home. On a more practical level, 
it strikes me as both a realistic project for this course, and a chance for me to engage with the topics taught in the 
course.
